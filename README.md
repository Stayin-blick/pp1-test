## Testing

- I tested this page on a laptop in google chrome
- Manually checked if site was responsive
- I also tested opening the site on an iphone 12pro using safari

## Bugs

- whilst tinkering with my navbar the first approach i took was using anchor tags but due to styling using the float property since it took it out of the normal flow my height was inactive and therefore background color didnt show. to resolve this i changed my anhors to lists

- when styling the table orginally my layout was (picture below) and that one column wasnt fitting on the page on small devices therefore i changed the layout with the table head on the left and table data displayed to the right instead of underneath

- issues with absolute links not displaying switched to relative links
